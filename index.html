            The first feature is the smart AI wish is represented in the first picture it's an animated AI that walk patroling an certain area, that yellow cube is a target.
            The AI will be walking arround different targets that the player cannot see while playing , whenever the AI arrive to a target a checking animation will be casted
            but what really make him feel smart is that there is alot of targets in the map in a huge area and he target switching is random so you may never see an AI following 
            the same path again , also you may never find him in the same position in the map.
            Also the AI is able to detect the player and get into a chase mode.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            
            The second feature represent the inventory menu , as shown in the image it shows the player what weapon he got and what are the stats of each specefic weapon also it 
            shows the amount of health the player has and you can change to different weapons using it for those who dislike keybinds.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              As you can see in the picture the third feature dosen't need alot of description , as a player you can kill the enemy AI , with 4 different weapon
              you can the see the dead body of the AI.

          <p>
            Six months after joining <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">HolbertonSchool</a> i saw a peer that is one cohort ahead of mine 
            making a project on unity then i started wondering what if i study unity i mean before i joined the school all i did is grinding in games 
            i always enjoyed playing games but somehow i never tought about creating one. Then i started thinking seriously of following the AR/VR speciality,
            well i got hooked into it and i couldn't even wait another 3 months till i finish the year to start it so i started learning about unity and C# 
            and decided that my Portfolio project will be either a 2D or a 3D game i made a 2D mini game but i wanted something bigger i wanted an entier 3D 
            open world so i started building this project a First Person Player game where you assault an entier island as a rogue looking for death, or as
            a military agent that has as a mission to wipe out some ex assassins or as a fisher man waking up in an unknown island after fighting with death to
            survive in ocean and having to survive while encountering mutated humans, the story line diden't mean much to me i just wanted to create my own 
            open world game.
