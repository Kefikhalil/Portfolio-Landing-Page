        <h1>Fundamental Problem Of Traffic</h1>
        <h2>
          Coordination - not cars - is the problem because we are humans with a

          <h3>Dis-coordination</h3>
          <p>
            This discoordination limits how many cars can get through and
            intersection and when one backs up to the next that's when
            city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear

          <h3>Tailgating:</h3>
          <p>
            Tailgating is trouble , Not just because it makes accidents more
            likely but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if
            the driver ahead breakes.

          <h3>Why phantom traffic jams form</h3>
          <div class="video">
            <p>
              If there are enough cars on a highway, any minor disruptions to
              the flow of traffic can cause a self-reinforcing chain reaction:
              one car brakes slightly, and the ones behind it brake just a bit
              more to avoid hitting it, with the braking eventually amplifying
              until it produces a wave of stopped or slowed traffic. "These
              traffic waves arise from small perturbations in a uniform traffic
              flow, like a bump in the road, or a driver braking after a moment
              of inattention," says Benjamin Seibold, a mathematician at Temple
              University who's worked with colleagues on understanding the
              phenomenon. ONE CAR BRAKES SLIGHTLY, AND THE ONES BEHIND IT BRAKE
              JUST A BIT MORE Even when cars leave this traffic wave, though,
              the wave itself doesn't disappear: it gradually drifts backward,
              against the direction of traffic. "It's typically 100 to 1000
              meters long, and it usually begins with vehicles running into a
              sudden increase in density at the start, and a drop in velocity,"
              Seibold says. "Then, after that, they slowly accelerate again."
